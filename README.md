# Welcome

This repository is for my Fall 2019 IT 5236 Distributed and Mobile Systems course.

The "webapp" folder contains a simple "To Do" web application. To get the web application working, you will need to (1) copy the contents of the "webapp" folder onto a web server with PHP support; (2) create a MySQL database named "IT5236" along with a database user account that has access to the database; (3) create a table in the database using the SQL found in sql/IT5236.sql; (4) rename "configuration-sample.php" to "configuration.php"; (5) edit "configuration.php" to include the username and password from step two.
